## Notes
No support will be given if you want to use this fork, use [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) instead.
Due to circumstances I cannot interact with the Vencord repository, so I decided to make a rebranded fork so I can work on plugins on my own.
If you are a vencord contributor (or Ven themself) feel free to take any modifications I make and cherry-pick them upstream.

No ill-meaning is behind the name RotCord, the discord client-mod namespace is oversaturated, so it wasn't easy to pick a name.

Additionally I'll keep the `dist` files named as Vencord, to keep compatibility with Vencord loaders (eg Vesktop).

<summary>Using RotCord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it
